# Master Thesis Operator Station

> **WARNING**: 100% of this project has been vibe-coded. It works only for EXACTLY my use-case, may break at any time, and almost certainly contain grave security flaws.

A comprehensive web-based research platform for flight simulation studies, providing integrated tools for program management, GPS tracking, psychological testing, flight data analysis, and event logging. Built in Go with a modern web interface, this system supports aviation human factors research and flight simulation experiments.

## üéØ Overview

The Master Thesis Operator Station is a modular research platform designed for aviation psychology and flight simulation research. It provides researchers with a unified interface to manage flight simulation software, track aircraft positions, conduct psychological assessments, analyze flight data, and maintain detailed audit logs of experimental sessions.

The platform features a comprehensive **overview page** that serves as a central navigation hub, providing easy access to all system modules through an intuitive card-based interface. From the overview, researchers can quickly navigate to the Program Manager for flight software control, the Mental Rotation Test for cognitive assessments, or the Data Analysis module for flight data visualization.
